### Analysis of Political Campaign Donations
The main objective of this project is to trace public donations back to their donors and estabilish a graph of possible relationships, being aware of the [six-degrees-of-separation problem](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255614427_Six_Degrees_of_Separation_in_Online_Society) so to find possible frauds.

### Worker's Party
